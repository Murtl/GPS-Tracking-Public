# GPS-Tracking-Public
This is my first big Project, which I created with a bunch of other students as a semester Project.
It won the third place out of 40 Projects.
Now its just a Showcase, because the JavaScript API from Google would cost, so you are only able to see the developer Map but it mostly works!

If you want to run it, follow these steps:
- clone the repo
  `git clone https://github.com/Murtl/studienprojekt-ss22.git`
- run npm install
  `npm install`
- run npm run start (start localhost to look at it)
  `npm run start`

Please note that you need to replace the placeholders in the following files with your firebase project information to run the project yourself:
- src/firebase.ts

Moreover, you need to exchange all places of `YOUR_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` with your own Google Maps API Key.
